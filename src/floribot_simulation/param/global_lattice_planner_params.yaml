SBPLLatticePlanner:
  planner_type: ADPlanner               # Specifies which planner to use. It can either be "ARAPlanner" for ARA* or "ADPlanner" for AD*.
  allocated_time: 5.0                   # The amount of time given to the planner to find a solution. 
  initial_epsilon: 3.0                  # The value the heuristic is scaled by for the first search. This value must be greater or equal to 1.
  environment_type: XYThetaLattice      # The type of environment being searched. Currently, XYThetaLattice is the only supported environment. 
  forward_search: false                 # The direction the search is done in. If you are using AD* you should use backward search for fast replanning times. For ARA* it doesn't matter too much which direction you use.
  primitive_filename: ""                # The path to a motion primitive file. This MUST be specified by the user for the planner to work.
  force_scratch_limit: 500              # The parameter only matters if you are using AD*. If at least this many map cells have changed since the last plan was generated, the planner will not reuse previous search information and instead plan from scratch. 
  nominalvel_mpersecs: 0.5              # The linear velocity of the robot in meters/sec
  timetoturn45degsinplace_secs: 1.5     # The time it takes the robot to turn 45 degrees in place in seconds.
  lethal_obstacle: 253                  # The cost of an obstacle in the planner's version of the costmap. All other values in the costmap are scaled accordingly.
